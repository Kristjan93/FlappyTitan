# HTML5 CSS-based Game

This game project has the following:

* 1024x768 pixel game canvas.
* All positions and sizes defined using a 10px em. This means that the game could be scaled up and down by changing the base font-size. This is one way to make the graphics responsive.
* A simple game loop which calculates delta and can be started and stopped.
* A player entity which can be moved around the canvas using the arrow keys.
* A "Game Over" screen when player is moved outside bounds, where the game can be restarted.

## Setup

```
npm install
bower install
