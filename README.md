# HTML5 CSS-based Game

This game was inspired by the popular anime series Attack on Titan.
The project has the following attributes:

* All functionality requirements given in the project description were met and more
* A simple game loop which calculates delta and can be started and stopped.
* A flying Captain Levi looking for titans inside the walls of Shiganshina
* All positions and sizes defined using a 10px em. This means that the game could be scaled up and down by changing the base font-size. This is one way to make the graphics responsive.
* Adaptable full screen game canvas.
* jQuery mobile was used to integrate smartphone usage for our game. Tested and works on iOS devices (Chrome browser
* All moving graphics were rendered in 3d taking advantage of full hardware acceleration)
